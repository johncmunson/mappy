This project was a code challenge I completed for a really cool company called [Banzai](https://teachbanzai.com/), where they aim to teach financial literacy through a range of software products.

The [map](https://johncmunson.github.io/mappy/) was built with nothing but plain ol' HTML, CSS, and JS.
